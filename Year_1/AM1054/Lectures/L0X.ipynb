Try parts 3 and 4 of the tutorial, to get most of the language features for the current course.  If you are interested in learning more, try part 5 of the tutorial, in particular 5.5 on *Dictionaries* (`dict`s) is very useful (we have actually used `dict`s already, for example in the context of `sympy.subs`).  Beyond the tutorial, there is also the more formal specification of the full python language for reference. I sometimes use for example the lists of all [build-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) and [built-in types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).\n",
