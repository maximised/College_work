    "\n",
    "By now you should have gained a certain familiarity with the `jupyter` interface and know that the *green* frame indicates that you are able to type in a cell, while the *blue* frame means that you are not. This change in behaviour is referred to as *edit mode* (green) and *command mode* (blue).  There is also a little pencil in the corner, which indicates *edit mode*.  To change from *edit mode* to *command mode* you type `Esc`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also another nice shortcut for changing into *command mode*, namely `ctrl-Return` which executes the current cell, and puts you into *command mode* with the current cell selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is *command mode* actually useful?  In command mode you have a number of quick key-board shortcuts at your disposal, which make editing notebooks much more efficient, once you get used to them.  To get a list of available shortcuts type `h` in command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most useful keys in comman mode for me are \n",
    "\n",
    "* `cursor up` and `cursor down` to quickly move among cells\n",
    "* `m` to convert a cell into a **m**arkdown cell\n",
    "* `a` and `b` to insert a fresh cell **a**bove and **b**elow the currently selcted cell\n",
    "* `s` to save the current status of the notebook as a checkpoint. You can return later to this position using `File -> Revert to Checkpoint`\n",
    "* `x` cuts the currently selected cell\n",
    "* `v` pastes a previously cut cell below the current one.\n",
    "* `y` converts the cell back into Code.\n",
    "* `shift-cursor up/down`: select more than one cell for copy/cut/ \n",
    "* `i` `i` (press `i` twice): interrupt the current calculation, for example if you created an infinte loop. \n",
    "* `0` `0`: restart the Python interpreter.  After this, you need to execute the first cell to re-import libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular in preparation for the exam, you should practice emergency routines how to recover from accidental deleting of your answers and similar.  When you use `s` in command mode, it sets a checkpoint. Even better is, if you explitly make copies of your file using `File-> Make a Copy` which generates a copy of your current file appended with `Copy0`, `Copy1`, etc.  I therefore recommend to recularly do a `File-> Make a Copy` during the exam to have backups along the way. Note that after you make a copy, the copy actually automatically opens in a new tab.  You should however continue to work on your original file, not on the copy! Therefore you need to go back to the tab with your original exam file to continue your work there. Practice this before your exam!\n",

    "Cells come in different types, `Code`, `Markdown` and Heading cells, and need to be executed with `Shift-Return` or `Ctrl-Return` to produce output.

    "Let us revise some of the syntax we use in `Code` cells.  As we know by now, python is very sensitive to correct indentation.  In fact, indentation is part of the language and indicates the length of logical blocks.  An important point to note is that indentation in a new line can only be increased, if the previous line finishes with a colon (`:`), for  example in \n",

    "Similarly, when we use \n",
    "\n",
    "    if a<1.0:\n",
    "        print(\"less than one\")\n",
    "    elif a < 2.0:\n",

    "        \n",
    "Indentation makes it clear, when which logical block of code begins and ends. The `elif` I used above is simply means *else if* and you can use a couple of them in a row. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the colon *requires* an indented block to start at the next line, you are not allowed to simply leave it out. For example if you decided to do nothing in the `elif a < 2.0` case you need to use the empty statement `pass` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    if a<1.0:\n",
    "        print(\"less than one\")\n",
    "    elif a < 2.0:\n",

    "Apart from `def` and `if` constructions, the only other structures with a colon and subsequent indentation we covered are `for` and `while` loops, typically used in the form:\n",

    "    for i in range(10):\n",
    "        print(\"Current number is \"+str(i))\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you would like to break out of a loop early, for example if something unexpected has happened, or you have found the result you wanted. This is done using the `break` statement, which immediately leaves the innermost loop, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in range(10):\n",
    "        print(\"Current number is \"+str(i))\n",
    "        if i == 5:\n",
    "            break\n",
    "    print(i)\n",

    "        if i == 2:\n",
    "            continue\n",

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Apart from the indentation rules, the bracketing rules in python is something to get used to. Python makes use of round brackets, `(` and `)`, square brackets, `[` and `]`, and sometimes curly brackets `{` and `}`.  You should know, when to use what. \n",
    "Brackets strictly come in pairs, and need to be closed strictly in the order and fashion they are opened.  Before the last bracket is not closed, Python will not process new statements.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Square Brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with the square brackets. There are two uses for square brackets in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Firstly they are used to define lists. The elements of the list are separated by commas. So for example\n",
    "\n",
    "        a = [\"Hi\", 4, 2.3]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    would define a list with three elements.  So far in the course, we mainly considered list of numbers, but of course, python can do more than that and lists can contain all types of things, including strings or other lists.  For example\n",
    "\n",
    "        b = [[1,2],\"Hi\",4]\n",
    "        \n",
    "    We often use the empty list\n",
    "        \n",
    "        c = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. The second use of the square bracket is for indexing. For example in the last case we can access a given element in the list through\n",
    "\n",
    "        print(b[1])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Remember that indexing in python starts at 0! You can get the last element in a list through\n",
    "    \n",
    "        b[-1]\n",
    "        \n",
    "    and you can get a range of elements with the colon notation `mylist[start:stop:step]` which gives back a list of elements of `[mylist[start], mylist[start + step], mylist[start+2*step], ...]`, until we reach the index `stop`. (Note that `mylist[stop]` itself is not part of this list.). Example: \n",
    "    \n",
    "        d = [1,5,3,6,7,10]\n",
    "        d[2:4]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Round Brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "Round brackets have the following uses in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Order algebraic operations as you learn in school: `(2+3)*4`\n",
    "2. to list the parameters when a function is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "        def my_add(a,b=3):\n",
    "            return a+b\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. to list the function arguments, when a function is called:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        my_add(5,4)\n",
    "        \n",
    "4. to define a *[tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences)*.  I did not explicitly talk about tuples yet, although in some places I have implicitly used them. For example in \n",
    "        \n",
    "        plt.xlim((-2,10))\n",
    "        \n",
    "    the `(-2,10)` is an example of a *tuple*. Similarly I used it in some of the function definitions in L06 to simply group things together.  For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        def linear_approx(x,(x1,f1),(x2,f2)):\n",
    "            return f1*(x-x2)/(x1-x2)+f2*(x-x1)/(x2-x1)\n",
    "            \n",
    "     Here again `(x1,f1)` and `(x2,f2)` are formally *tuples*.  In python, tuples are in many respects similar to lists, we can also give a tuple a name for example try \n",
    "         a = (3,4)\n",
    "         a[1]\n",
    "    The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples cannot be changed anymore after they are created.  Sometimes tuples are therefore called *immutable* lists.  The concept of mutable versus immutable objects is very important for more advanced python, but I left it out in this beginner course. All we require at this point is to understand that tuples are used to group parameters in a function definition in a natural way. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Curly Brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "Curly brackets in Python have two uses\n",
    "\n",
    "1. use as formatter, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "        print(\"{:20}|{:20}\".format(3.0,2.0))\n",
    "2. Define a *[dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)*.  Similar to tuples, I did not formally introduce dictionaries at all in this course as it is a more advanced (but very powerful!) feature.  I only required dictionaries once in the course, when I did in L04:\n",
    "\n",
    "        expr.evalf(subs={x:0.04})\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Here this code simply means that `x` gets replaced by the number `0.04`.  \n"

    "As you notice, all homepages of the projects we covered finished with the TLD `.org` rather than `.com`. This is in line with the fact that Python itself and the full infrastructure surrounding it are available free of charge. What is more, all the programmes we used in the course are available as [*open source*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) which means that the source code is available to you for free.  This is an important aspect for doing scientific work, as it puts *you* the user in full control of what happens on your computer and ensures *reproducibility*. It also ensures that there is no company or other entity that you need to blindly trust. At least in principle you can check the code yourself, improve the code as required and then share your improvements with others as you like. *Open source* therefore implements the software equivalent of the *standing on the shoulders of giants* principle which was first formulated by *Isaac Newton* as a cornerstone of scientific progress.
