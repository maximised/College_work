Q 1:
Set up the wolf dataset as before and in class-
make are the 'local' variables, including 'Hunting'.
Using the variable 'Hunting', produce a table to see how many male wolves are in each hunting group.

Create these two subsets:
Light_M = male wolves which are lightly hunted
and Heavy_M = male wolves who are heavily hunted.

and make a histogram of each of these subsets for the variable Tpgmg (Testosterone) and place the
two histograms one above the other using par(mfrow()) function.  (i.e. 2 plots on the one page- one above the other).

Q2:
Make one histogram of the male wolves now using the following commands exactly:

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
hist(Light_M$Tpgmg,main='Testosterone in Male Wolves',xlab='Testosterone (pg/mg)',col=5)
hist(Heavy_M$Tpgmg,density=10,add=T) 

b.
Now using xlim and ylim (look at the two histograms in Q1 to figure them out) fix that graph.

Q3:
Change the fonts as follows:
labelling font is bold; title font is bold and italic; axes (i.e. the numbers on the axes) are italic.

Also:
Specify the bin size for the bars as '2'.  Do this using the 'breaks=' argument of hist.
Hint: using the 'seq()' function you can specify breaks as seq(min,max,by=2), where min and max are from the xlim you specified.  You will need to specify the breaks for both histograms.

Change the bin size to 3 (if you use seq the max may need to be a multiple of 3 that is higher than your previous xlim).  See how the histogram profile changes.

Q4:  (May be Homework-)
Add a legend to the plot from Q3,  as was done in class.  
Recall that the command arguments for legend are different than for boxplot.
In legend:
bty means: do you want a box or not (Y/N)
angle: the angle for lines that will be drawn- this combined with density is instead of the 'density' argument in boxplot.
density: whether to have a solid box or lines
fill: fill the colour squares
