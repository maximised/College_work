Q1:
Generate vectors of length 1000 for:

Normal with mean 10 and sd=3
set.seed(1)
norms=rnorm(1000,10,3)
mean(norms)


Uniform from 1 to 10
set.seed(1)
uni=runif(1000,1,10)


Poisson with lambda=15
set.seed(1)
pois<- rpois(1000, 15) # generate 1000 numbers
mean(pois)


and Binomial with 20 draws and p=.25
set.seed(1)
binar=rbinom(1000,20,.25)
mean(binar)

get the means for each and
and put the fours histgrams from these on one page with titles.

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(norms);hist(uni);hist(pois);hist(binar)



Assume that the test scores of a college entrance exam fits a normal distribution. Furthermore, the mean test score is 72, and the standard deviation is 15.2. What is the percentage of students scoring 84 or more in the exam? 
Hint: use pnorm and read the help file for it- you will want the argument lower.tail=FALSE.


We apply the function pnorm of the normal distribution with mean 72 and standard deviation 15.2. Since we are looking for the percentage of students scoring higher than 84, we are interested in the upper tail of the normal distribution.
pnorm(84, mean=72, sd=15.2, lower.tail=FALSE) 
[1] 0.21492

Answer:
The percentage of students scoring 84 or more in the college entrance exam is 21.5%. 



Question: Suppose widgits produced at Acme Widgit Works have probability 0.005 of being defective. Suppose widgits are shipped in cartons containing 25 widgits. What is the probability that a randomly chosen carton contains exactly one defective widgit?
Question Rephrased: What is P(X = 1) when X has the B(25, 0.005) distribution?
Hint: use dbinom and read the help file-

Answer:
dbinom(1, 25, 0.005)

Question

What are the 10th, 20th, and so forth up to 90th quantiles of the B(10, 1/3) distribution? 
Hint: to get eg the 90th percentile use qbinom(.9,10,1/3)-

qbinom(0.1, 10, 1/3)
qbinom(0.2, 10, 1/3)
# and so forth, or all at once with
qbinom(seq(0.1, 0.9, 0.1), 10, 1/3)
